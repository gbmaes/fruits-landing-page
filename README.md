# fruits-landing-page

## Wanna get healthy but don't know how? Let my landing page help you out! ðŸ‘Œ


This project was about developing a landing page for a healthy food company. I learned a bit more about how Bootstrap can come in handy when developing responsive websites.


The company's goal with this webpage is to teach how food leftovers can be turned into delicious healthy meals.


My goal was to strengthen my knowledge of Bootstrap and responsiveness.
